Founded by Father Michael J. McGivney, assistant pastor of St. Mary's Church in New Haven in 1882, the Knights of Columbus remain true to the founding principles of charity, unity, and fraternity.

We provide aid and assistance to the sick, disabled, and needy members and families. We provided service to the communities where we live and promote social and intellectual fellowship among our members and their families through educational, charitable, religious, social welfare, war relief, and public relief works. 

The Knights of Columbus now includes over 15,100 councils and 1.9 million members. Although we are an international organization each council concentrates its efforts to benefit local parishes and communities.
